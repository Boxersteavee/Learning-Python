# Learning-Python

Hello, this repo contains all of my projects from when i was learning python in summer 2020.

# First Project

This was my first project, it contains a few files of which all coded by my and mostly followed by FreeCodeCamp's 4 hour python beginners guide. Most files were slightly modified to suit me.

# Coding For Beginners

This project was the second i followed. I was following a book called Coding python for beginners. I made a few of the projects it had and modified to suit me.

# Python Games

This project was left half complete due to other things i was doing. I made a working pong game and a half working snake game (opens, shows grid, crashes).

# Why post them?

I posted this repo so the world can see what i have done, it will stay online as a history. Also you are free to download this repo, modify it and fork it.
